This folder contains code that implements a C++ representation of BSpline data.
This includes a function for evaluating the spline at parametric points.

Files:
~ geometry.h: the (template) code for the BSpline itself
~ interface.txt: a version of geometry.h stripped of the implementation details
~ geometry.cpp: testing code
~ Makefile: running 'make test' builds and runs the 'geometry' executable
